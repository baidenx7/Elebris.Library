### Series of systems for an RPG system I'm working on

##### This is intended as a collection of loosely coupled items to set up an RPG, I will be using it in my Unity projects, and eventually APIs, but I'm hoping that people can find it useful for all manners of different systems and use-cases

##### I'm currently working from the base up, starting with character generation

##### Features to follow are:
- Character Stats (base and gained on level up)
- Combat calculations
- Skill System (leveling, balancing(weaken certain features to bolster others), casting)
- Inventories
- Vendors/NPCs
- Crafting
- Tag systems (Gear, Units, Skills) (Built upon POE's)
- AI system (Similar to Rimworld)
- "static data" will be stored in a relational database
- "non-static"(units, crafted gear) will be stored in a non-relational Database
