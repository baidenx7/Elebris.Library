Each character is created with 3 (randomly generated) classes that (help) determine the attribute spread of the unit

Attributes: The basis for all stats, This determines how quickly units scale as well as their starting point with many of the stats

PrimaryStats: 
Brawn, Dexterity, Ability are Activity Stats (SC, EA, WI)
Charm, Intimidation, Stoicism are Social Stats (EI, AS, CW)
Knowledgeable, Resourceful, Inquisitive are Adventure Stats (IC, WA, ES)

SecondaryStats: Encompasses a wide WIDE range of stats 



All of these are held in CharacterValues


Spirit, Mana and Stamina are contained in Valueholders (as is barrier and health)

after classes, attributes and stats are set, the next order of business is personality, strengths and flaws
